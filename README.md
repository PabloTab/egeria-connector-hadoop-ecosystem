# Apache Atlas Repository Connector

[Apache Atlas](https://atlas.apache.org) is an open source metadata repository. This connector provides an example
implementation for interacting with a metadata repository through the open metadata standards of Egeria.

Note that currently the connector implementation is a work-in-progress -- more details on the usage and implementation
of the connector will follow once it is in a more ready-to-use state.
