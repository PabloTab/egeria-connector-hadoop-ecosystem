# Release 1.1

Release 1.1 focuses on establishing a baseline connector that can be used to
integrate metadata from existing Apache Atlas environments.

Below are the highlights:

- Exposure of all basic read and find operations defined as part of the
    [Open Metadata Repository Services (OMRS)](https://egeria.odpi.org/open-metadata-implementation/repository-services/),
    allowing Apache Atlas to participate in a broader metadata cohort and
    federation through Egeria's Enterprise Connector.

- An initial set of [mapped metadata object types](../docs/mappings)
    that include those most commonly used within existing Apache Atlas environments.

- An Event Mapper to automatically publish changes to metadata within an Apache Atlas
    environment to the rest of the Egeria metadata cohort.

- Built on release 1.1 of Egeria, and compatible with Apache Atlas version 2.0
    onwards.
