# Apache Atlas Connector Release Notes

## Latest Release

- _None_

## Older Releases

- _None_

## Future Releases

Our master branch is currently taking code for all future releases.
We integrate code for partial function as soon as it is stable and has no
impact on released function. So you will see support for more function than is
officially released. This way you can start to experiment with unreleased
functionality and provide feedback to help steer its eventual release.

The draft release notes for our future planned releases are below:

- [Release 1.1](release-notes-1-1.md) - Planned October 2019
    - Read-only OMRS connector for Apache Atlas
- [Release 1.2](release-notes-1-2.md) - Planned November 2019
    - Mandatory OMRS profile conformance for Apache Atlas connector
    - Migration of Apache Atlas connector repository to a broader Hadoop-focused repository
    - Tech Preview of OMRS metadata maintenance operations for Apache Atlas connector
- [Release 1.3](release-notes-1-3.md) - Planned December 2019
    - Add mappings for data processing, to feed into lineage
    - OMRS metadata maintenance conformance for Apache Atlas connector
